# Migration Notes: Lovable to OverSkill Template

## Overview

This template was created by migrating from the lovable_20250728 template and adding OverSkill-specific requirements while maintaining all UI components and modern React patterns.

## Key Additions to Lovable Template

### 1. OverSkill Analytics Integration
- Added `src/lib/analytics.ts` with comprehensive tracking
- Auto-tracks page views, errors, and user interactions
- Includes session tracking and performance metrics

### 2. Supabase Integration with RLS
- Added `src/lib/supabase.ts` with Row-Level Security helpers
- `setRLSContext()` function for proper tenant isolation
- `withRLS()` helper for authenticated operations
- Auto-initialization on app load

### 3. OverSkill Branding
- Updated meta tags in `index.html` for OverSkill attribution
- Added "Remix with OverSkill" floating badge in `App.tsx`
- Proper Open Graph and Twitter Card tags

### 4. Cloudflare Workers Configuration
- Added `wrangler.toml` for edge deployment
- Environment variable configuration for production/development
- Proper build configuration in `vite.config.ts`

### 5. Enhanced Package.json
- Added deployment script: `"deploy": "npm run build && wrangler deploy"`
- Added required dependencies:
  - `@supabase/supabase-js`
  - `zustand` for state management
  - `wrangler` for Cloudflare deployment

### 6. TypeScript Environment

## Agent Loop Compatibility

The template structure supports the AI agent loop workflow:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular component structure
- Error boundaries and tracking
- Progress verification points
- Iterative development friendly

## Usage with V5 Builder

This template is designed to work with the new AppBuilderV5 that implements the agent loop strategy:
- Supports iterative goal achievement
- Provides clear verification points
- Enables context preservation across iterations
- Facilitates error recovery and debugging

## Next Steps

1. Update AppBuilderV5 to use this template
2. Implement the agent loop logic from the strategy document
3. Test with various app generation scenarios
4. Monitor analytics for generation success rates
